      'LONDON (AP) — The term “metaverse” seems to be everywhere. Facebook is hiring thousands of engineers in Europe to work on it, while video game companies are outlining their long-term visions for what some consider the next big thing online.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse, which could spring up again when Facebook releases earnings Monday, is the latest buzzword to capture the tech industry’s imagination.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It could be the future, or it could be the latest grandiose vision by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that doesn’t turn out as expected or isn’t widely adopted for years — if at all.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Plus, many have concerns about a new online world tied to a social media giant that could get access to even more personal data and is accused of failing to stop harmful content.\n' +

      'Here’s what this online world is all about:\n' +
      '\n' +
      'WHAT IS THE METAVERSE?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Think of it as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Zuckerberg has described it as a “virtual environment” you can go inside of — instead of just looking at on a screen. Essentially, it’s a world of endless, interconnected virtual communities where people can meet, work and play, using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps or other devices.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It also will incorporate other aspects of online life such as shopping and social media, according to Victoria Petrock, an analyst who follows emerging technologies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“It’s the next evolution of connectivity where all of those things start to come together in a seamless, doppelganger universe, so you’re living your virtual life the same way you’re living your physical life,” she said.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But keep in mind that “it’s hard to define a label to something that hasn’t been created,” said Tuong Nguyen, an analyst who tracks immersive technologies for research firm Gartner.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook warned it would take 10 to 15 years to develop responsible products for the metaverse, a term coined by writer Neal Stephenson for his 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'WHAT WILL I BE ABLE TO DO IN THE METAVERSE?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Things like go to a virtual concert, take a trip online, and buy and try on digital clothing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse also could be a game-changer for the work-from-home shift amid the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of seeing co-workers on a video call grid, employees could see them virtually.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook has launched meeting software for companies, called Horizon Workrooms, to use with its Oculus VR headsets, though early reviews have not been great. The headsets cost $300 or more, putting the metaverse’s most cutting-edge experiences out of reach for many.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For those who can afford it, users would be able, through their avatars, to flit between virtual worlds created by different companies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another,” Zuckerberg says.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Tech companies still have to figure out how to connect their online platforms to each other. Making it work will require competing technology platforms to agree on a set of standards, so there aren’t “people in the Facebook metaverse and other people in the Microsoft metaverse,” Petrock said. ...',

      'Facebook has announced major investments in "the metaverse," a virtual reality that could one day coexist alongside the physical world. DW breaks down what it is — and how you might already be in it.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "It's been a long day. You've spent the morning hopping between conference rooms, stealing five minutes in the break room to talk to a co-worker about a concert you're going to that evening. You meet at the venue after work, excited to see your favorite K-Pop band play live. After the show ends, you buy a T-shirt and try to forget that you saw your ex-boyfriend there.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'A pretty typical day. The twist? You did it all without leaving your home. Welcome to the metaverse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'What is the metaverse?\n' +
      'The metaverse has no single creator or definition. It can be defined loosely as a digital reality, akin to the World Wide Web, but combining aspects of social media, augmented reality, online gaming and cryptocurrencies to allow users to act and interact virtually. While the concept is still in its infancy, its potential is huge.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '"I\'m fairly sure at this point that […] the metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy," Jensen Hang, CEO of computer graphics chipmaker NVIDIA, has said. NVIDIA, a company whose investment in the metaverse has led some to predict it will one day outgrow Apple, is just one of many companies scrambling to stake a claim in the metaverse goldrush. Epic Games, Microsoft and many others have launched initiatives of their own.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For years now, Facebook has been investing in virtual and augmented reality for the metaverse. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects people will one day think of the social media company instead as a metaverse company. This week, Facebook doubled down on the project, announcing a major metaverse initiative in Europe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Bringing everything together\n' +
      '"Instead of just viewing content — you are in it," Mark Zuckerberg told tech blog The Verge in July, contrasting the idea of the metaverse with standard "two-dimensional" webpages that currently populate the internet.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Iterations of the metaverse have existed for years, whether as social media, virtual reality, online gaming or the cryptocurrency sphere.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Interactive and world-building games such as Second Life, Fortnite, Minecraft and Roblox all have elements of the metaverse. There, users can work and collaborate, attend events and exchange real-world money for virtual goods and services.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Thus far, however, these worlds have been largely self-contained. Metaverse visionaries predict a virtual universe where one might move seamlessly between these different types of digital worlds. Users could even retain the same virtual identity — in the form of a digital avatar — and capital they own in one world would hold the same value in another. Everyone would pay with a universally accepted digital currency. ...',

      'Facebook has made an announcement that it will soon be employing 10,000 high-skilled workers in Europe to help build its “metaverse," which it considers to be the future of the internet. Even its founder, Mark Zuckerberg has come forward to speak about how Facebook would “effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company."\n' +
      '\n' +
      "What is 'Metaverse'? \n" +
      '"Meta", the prefix of the term, comes from Greek and means beyond, after or across. Hence, the term metaverse can be understood as a place that is beyond the world or the universe as we know it, one that exists in the virtual realm but feels just as real.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It was coined in a 1992 sci-fi novel called Snow Crash, written by Neal Stephenson, where the term referred to the convergence of physical, augmented, and virtual reality where people interact with each other using their avatars. This whole idea is being hailed as the next step in the development of the internet along with creating new infrastructure and real-time 3D worlds. \n' +
      '\n' +
      'A metaverse can be broken down into two parts. \n' +
      '\n' +
      'One of them deals with building a blockchain-based metaverse, using NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Some of the examples are Decentraland and The Sandbox, which allow people to purchase virtual parcels of land and build their own environments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Is this a new phenomenon? \n' +
      'Not really, not for the gaming enthusiasts at least. For anyone who has watched The Matrix or is aware of Fortnite and Ready Player One, it would be easier to comprehend the process and the functioning this concept will be based upon. Facebook is planning something very similar to what these gaming products offer; somewhat like taking the player inside a virtual world where meetings could be held using virtual reality (VR) headsets, in a chosen avatar and background setting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, the virtual world envisaged by Facebook is not just going to be about gaming only but rather it would be more inclusive and expansive in terms of providing facilities from office to entertainment. The concept aims to provide an online world where people can interact, collaborate and communicate without needing to be physically present in the same space. ...',

      'A couple of years ago, right before COVID shut down the world, I was sitting with Bob Iger in his office at the Disney headquarters in Burbank and he gleefully asked me if I wanted to see something cool. “Sure,” I said, unsure what magic trick he was about to pull out of his hat. He walked over to his giant wooden desk, covered with Star Wars, Marvel and Disney paraphernalia, and grabbed his iPad. He then sat down on the couch and proceeded to show me video clips from movies Disney was working on at the time, all footage of people and animals that I was sure were real (filmed with actors) but that Iger informed me were 100% CGI. My mind literally couldn’t decipher between reality and a computer-generated version of it. As I sat speechless, Iger looked at me with his trademark all-American smile, and said, “The crazy part about all of this, is that every time we render a new scene, the technology used to make it is already outdated. It’s already obsolete.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If you’ve heard lately about this thing called the metaverse, you’re getting closer to having that same experience I had on Iger’s couch, but instead, you’ll be doing it from your own couch, sitting at your computer, or using a gaming console. Or perhaps you’ll experience it outside, on your smartphone, using a virtual reality headset, and a pair of digitally connected glasses or even contact lenses. You will be entering a digital world that looks so real, your brain won’t know if it’s a digital rendering or reality. And the metaverse, for better and probably for worse, is about to change everything.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So what exactly is this thing? The term “metaverse” was first coined in Snow Crash, a science fiction novel published in 1992, in which author Neal Stephenson imagines a virtual world where humans, as avatars, interact with each other (and other artificially intelligent versions of people, almost bots if you will) in an online virtual world that has been built to resemble the real world. Since then, as technology has grown and morphed, the ideas around the metaverse have too, and we’ve seen iterations of it brought to dramatic life in Ernest Cline’s novel Ready Player One, where people interact—and also die—in the virtual Oasis, or in the Matrix, where they die too. (Don’t worry, you’re not going to die in our metaverse, at least not yet.)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse is such a big idea that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he envisions a world where it changes the entire premise of his company. “I think over the next five years or so, in this next chapter of our company, I think we will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company,” he told The Verge in an interview earlier this year (prior to the latest round of scandals). “You can think about the metaverse as an embodied internet, where instead of just viewing content—you are in it.” (Zuckerberg is so obsessed with the idea of the metaverse that he is reportedly mulling changing the name of Facebook to Metaverse or something similar.)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The number of possibilities around the metaverse are endless, but you can easily imagine how it might change the way we interact in the same way that mobile devices have changed society today. In a world where the metaverse exists, rather than hosting a weekly meeting on Zoom with all of your coworkers, you could imagine meeting in a physical representation of your office, where each person looks like a digital version of themselves, seated at a digital coffee table drinking digital artisanal coffee and snacking on digital donuts. If that sounds a bit boring, you could meet somewhere else, perhaps in the past, like in 1776 New York City, or in the future, on a spaceship, or at the zoo, on another planet—if it made sense for the meeting, of course. You could choose not to be yourself, but rather some form of digital avatar you picked up at the local online NFT swap meet, or at a virtual Balenciaga store. You could dress like a bunny rabbit to go to the meeting. A dragon. A dead dragon. And that’s just one measly little meeting. Imagine what the rest of the metaverse might look like.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'You could play first-person shooter video games in the metaverse, that look like they’re in real life. You could take a British history class taught by a digital representation of King George III, or learn about the theory of relativity from Albert Einstein himself. You could attend a TED Talk, or give one, or go to church. You could hook up your exercise bike to race against Maurice Garin in the Tour de France. Or your running machine to race against Usain Bolt at the Olympics (and lose). You could go to the zoo. You could be an animal at the zoo. Visit the Louvre. Le Mans. The International Space Station. You could go for a walk on Mars. Neptune. Float in space. Play “red light, green light” with your friends in Squid Game. You could go shopping, trying on outfits that once you pay for, are actually mailed to your house. You could go to a theme park and ride the world’s biggest roller coaster and maybe even throw up in real life. There are also lots of potential dark sides of the metaverse. Don’t be surprised to see Nazi rallies and people who choose racist and dangerous avatars, or hackers stealing from people, or performing metaversal terrorism, whatever that becomes. All of this stuff could be for sale in crypto, where we buy and sell digital goods with Bitcoin or Ethereum.',

      '\n' +
      'When I hear that sound, I’m gone in my memory. I’m in the world of Ultima Online, my first and still favorite MMO. Ultima Online was an early example of a world within a world, complete with its own society: culture, laws, economy and even language.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'And little did I know it, I was experiencing the metaverse for the first time.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'What Is The Metaverse?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The term metaverse first leaped into our lexicon with the publication of Neal Stephenson’s essential 1992 science-fiction novel Snow Crash, in which he described human avatars interacting in a persistent, virtual world. In that world, “people could meet, claim territory, build things, make money and more.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'William Gibson also painted elaborate, often dystopian worlds in which inhabitants split their time between shared physical reality and a digital version, often blurring the line between the two. His world was less ToonTown than Stephenson’s and more gritty dystopia. In the past decade, we’ve oscillated between both visions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In short, the metaverse is the nexus point at which the virtual and real world come together. “The convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space,” reads a 2007 paper on the topic. “It is a fusion of both, while allowing users to experience it as either.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'How We Experience The Metaverse Today\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We often hear about the metaverse as something that’s around some distant corner. In reality, it’s already all around us.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I mentioned Ultima Online, but many other games in recent years have dabbled with a similar concept. Roblox and Fortnite allow players to create entire worlds, each with their distinct economies, that simultaneously exist within and outside of the broader economy. These worlds have even hosted events attended by millions of fans, like singer Ariana Grande’s recent concert in Fortnite as an official part of her Rift tour.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Augmented reality (AR) is another technology on the edges of the metaverse in common use today. What makes AR unique is it’s gone a few steps further in providing the consumer with more than just entertainment. For example, by using only a smartphone app, consumers can see how cosmetics will look on their skin or how furniture will look in their homes. This can save time and money.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'AR also kept consumers motivated to work on their health and fitness while they were stuck at home by essentially transporting them to a location outside of their home. Training app Zwift held a virtual Tour de France using at-home bike riders’ video feeds to create digital avatars who then raced through a digital course.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At Plott, we see the benefits of offering consumers solutions to their real-life challenges. We’ve built an entire business around bridging the gap between virtual and physical reality with our AR/XR products helping DIYers bring their home renovation projects to life.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So, the framework — the technologies and devices that can help us experience the metaverse — is in place. The current use cases are plentiful. And the biggest realization is that the metaverse is not an either/or proposition. The future is more likely to exist somewhere in between the world we know and the virtual frontier. ...',

      "CERTAIN NEOLOGISMS SEEM to pop up, then disappear, only to return in another guise. William Gibson's award-winning 1984 science fiction classic Neuromancer popularized the word cyberspace, a meaningless portmanteau that went viral and eventually became a shorthand expression describing the totality of the online world.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "We're now seeing something similar happen with the word metaverse, coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash where it referred to the successor of our two-dimensional Internet. The word resurfaced a short time later in the product road maps of a hundred failed startups and is returning now as the plaything of Big Tech.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "We're hearing that everyone will need access to the metaverse, that this virtual universe will be the place we'll all soon be working and playing. Whether anyone other than a few true believers would be willing to tolerate for more than a few minutes the sweaty, fogged-up insides of the head-mounted display needed to get there remains an open question.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Immersive virtual reality hasn't progressed much in conception or implementation from the systems prototyped three decades ago—certainly not enough to present it as the future of people's daily work environment. It's probably going to remain an awkward place to visit for a long time yet, so there must be a good reason to go.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "What, then, could such a metaverse be for? Could its purpose be so important that we'd willingly endure both the physical discomfort of wearing a head-mounted display and the often disturbingly unnatural representations of people in these 3D virtual worlds?\n" +
      '\n' +
      "The metaverse has always had two faces—one looking within, to our imaginations, the other focusing on the real world. Early efforts in this realm, such as ART+COM's T_Vision, made metaverses that represent the Earth, inspiring projects such as Google Earth, which offer a richer and more complex metaverse of the real. These are prototypes for the many metaverses that are to come because they provide us with enormously useful views of the real world.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'A fundamental but largely unrecognized power of virtual reality lies in its capacity to give us insight into processes either too large or too small to be directly observable. We can at a glance view something as big as our planet or as small as a cell, making things we understood only in the most abstract sense become both tangible and actionable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'These "metaversal" powers are of immense value because they allow us to observe and comprehend the nature and consequences of our activities. With such tools to help us see what we\'re doing—as individuals, as nations, and as a species—we gain the opportunity to learn from our actions. Without them, we\'re flying blind, manipulating our environment on a global scale, but without proper understanding of the consequences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "So if we technologists are going to build a metaverse, let's start with a mirror world: a high-fidelity reflection of the real world, in all of its richness, complexity, and unpredictability. Encompassing the totality of the world within such a metaverse won't be easy—it will no doubt take our best minds years of work. But along the way we will be learning because as we construct that mirror and gaze into it, our blind spots will be revealed. We can then take what we learn and immediately put it to work protecting the real environment around us. And that's reason enough to undertake a planet-scale construction project in cyberspace.",

      'IT WAS 2016, and Jordan Belamire was excited to experience QuiVr, a new fantastical virtual reality game, for the first time. With her husband and brother-in-law looking on, she put on a VR headset and became immersed in a snowy landscape. Represented by a disembodied set of floating hands along with a quiver, bow, and hood, Belamire was now tasked with taking up her weapons to fight mesmerizing hordes of glowing monsters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But her excitement quickly turned sour. Upon entering online multiplayer mode and using voice chat, another player in the virtual world began to make rubbing, grabbing, and pinching gestures at her avatar. Despite her protests, this behavior continued until Belamire took the headset off and quit the game.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'My colleagues and I analyzed responses to Belamire’s subsequent account of her “first virtual reality groping” and observed a clear lack of consensus around harmful behavior in virtual spaces. Though many expressed disgust at this player’s actions and empathized with Belamire’s description of her experience as “real” and “violating,” other respondents were less sympathetic—after all, they argued, no physical contact occurred, and she always had the option to exit the game.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Incidents of unwanted sexual interactions are by no means rare in existing social VR spaces and other virtual worlds, and plenty of other troubling virtual behaviors (like the theft of virtual items) have become all too common. All these incidents leave us uncertain about where “virtual” ends and “reality” begins, challenging us to figure out how to avoid importing real-world problems into the virtual world and how to govern when injustice happens in the digital realm.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Now, with Facebook predicting the coming metaverse and the proposal to move our work and social interactions into VR, the importance of dealing with harmful behaviors in these spaces is drawn even more sharply into focus. Researchers and designers of virtual worlds are increasingly setting their sights on more proactive methods of virtual governance that not only deal with acts like virtual groping once they occur, but discourage such acts in the first place while encouraging more positive behaviors too.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'These designers are not starting entirely from scratch. Multiplayer digital gaming—which has a long history of managing large and sometimes toxic communities—offers a wealth of ideas that are key to understanding what it means to cultivate responsible and thriving VR spaces through proactive means. By showing us how we can harness the power of virtual communities and implement inclusive design practices, multiplayer games help pave the way for a better future in VR.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'THE LAWS OF the real world—at least in their current state—are not well-placed to solve the real wrongs that occur in fast-paced digital environments. My own research on ethics and multiplayer games revealed that players can be resistant to “outside interference” in virtual affairs. And there are practical problems, too: In fluid, globalized online communities, it’s difficult to know how to adequately identify suspects and determine jurisdiction.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'And certainly, technology can’t solve all of our problems. As researchers, designers and critics pointed out at the 2021 Game Developers Conference, combatting harassment in virtual worlds requires deeper structural changes across both our physical and digital lives. But if doing nothing is not an option, and if existing real-world laws can be inappropriate or ineffective, in the meantime we must turn to technology-based tools to proactively manage VR communities. ...',

Maybe Facebook (or Epic, or Roblox, or dozens of smaller companies) is trying to take it over. And maybe it’s got something to do with NFTs?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unlike a lot of things The Verge covers, the metaverse is tough to explain for one reason: it doesn’t necessarily exist. It’s partly a dream for the future of the internet and partly a neat way to encapsulate some current trends in online infrastructure, including the growth of real-time 3D worlds.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But let’s get to the fun part. Will you start checking your Facebook feed in Fortnite with a pair of augmented reality glasses? Will your friends invite you to cyber-brunch instead of normal brunch? Time to jack in and figure it out.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SO, THE METAVERSE. THAT STARTED AS A SCIENCE FICTION THING, RIGHT?\n' +
      'Correct. Neal Stephenson famously coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992 novel Snow Crash, where it referred to a 3D virtual world inhabited by avatars of real people. Lots of other science fiction media includes metaverse-like systems (some of them predating Snow Crash). But Stephenson’s book remains one of the most common reference points for metaverse enthusiasts, along with Ernest Cline’s 2011 novel Ready Player One.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'AREN’T BOTH THOSE BOOKS SET IN HORRIBLE DYSTOPIAS?\n' +
      'Snow Crash’s metaverse is an outgrowth of Stephenson’s satirical corporation-dominated future America, but it’s undeniably depicted as having a cool side. (The protagonist is a master hacker who gets in katana fights at a virtual nightclub. No amount of narrative self-awareness can fool readers into thinking that’s not supposed to be fun.) Ready Player One’s virtual world is symbolically named the OASIS, and Cline portrays it as an almost utopian source of escapism in a horrible future.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On one hand, emulating the virtual worlds of Snow Crash or Ready Player One is less deliberately creepy than naming your tech initiative “Skynet” or your nutrient shake after Soylent Green. On the other hand, science fiction stories can conjure a vivid picture of “the metaverse” without illuminating how it should work or why it should exist.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'THEN WHAT IS THE REAL METAVERSE?\n' +
      'There’s no universally accepted definition of a real “metaverse,” except maybe that it’s a fancier successor to the internet. Silicon Valley metaverse proponents sometimes reference a description from venture capitalist Matthew Ball, author of the extensive Metaverse Primer:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“The Metaverse is an expansive network of persistent, real-time rendered 3D worlds and simulations that support continuity of identity, objects, history, payments, and entitlements, and can be experienced synchronously by an effectively unlimited number of users, each with an individual sense of presence.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook, arguably the tech company with the biggest stake in the metaverse, describes it more simply:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“The ‘metaverse’ is a set of virtual spaces where you can create and explore with other people who aren’t in the same physical space as you.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are also broader metaverse-related taxonomies like one from game designer Raph Koster, who draws a distinction between “online worlds,” “multiverses,” and “metaverses.” To Koster, online worlds are digital spaces — from rich 3D environments to text-based ones — focused on one main theme. Multiverses are “multiple different worlds connected in a network, which do not have a shared theme or ruleset,” including Ready Player One’s OASIS. And a metaverse is “a multiverse which interoperates more with the real world,” incorporating things like augmented reality overlays, VR dressing rooms for real stores, and even apps like Google Maps.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If you want something a little snarkier and more impressionistic, you can cite digital scholar Janet Murray — who has described the modern metaverse ideal as “a magical Zoom meeting that has all the playful release of Animal Crossing.” ...',

      'The metaverse is a growing topic in tech and some crypto circles, describing a virtual reality space into which users can log in and interact with one another using avatars to represent their real selves. It has been growing particularly in the gaming space with titles like Fortnite, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Roblox, and many others fostering a metaverse community for players. Social media websites such as Facebook are also pushing into the space with Horizon Worlds and is planning to hire 10,000 people in the European Union over the next five years to help build their vision of a metaverse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It’s no coincidence that this concept has sci-fi vibes to it, the term “metaverse” was originally coined in science fiction writer Neal Stephenson’s book “Snow Crash” in 1992 to describe a virtual world that people would plug into using their own virtual avatars. Online games like Second Life, which launched in 2003, were a pioneers for metaverse economies, allowing users to trade goods and services using their in-game Linden dollars — including virtual real estate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is also taking off among the decentralized finance crowd with platforms like Decentraland, an online metaverse space that calls itself the first fully decentralized virtual world owned by its users where they create, explore and trade virtual goods using smart contracts on the Decentraland marketplace. Along with virtual clothes and accessories you can purchase using the platform’s native MANA crypto, you can also secure virtual land parcels and estates.\n' +

      'These virtual properties could be vacant parcels for creators to build on, or structures that reflect real-life properties and completely original creations. They are represented by co-ordinates on the metaverse platform where users can meet up using their avatars to socialize and decorate their own spaces with collectibles.\n' +

      'ANDREW KIGUEL\n' +
      'Monetizing this space is starting to give rise to metaverse real estate companies, the first being Metaverse Property. Being a nascent industry, the company works to secure a wealth of land assets in the virtual real estate space. It focuses on buying and selling, managing business properties, offering rentals in the metaverse, virtual land development, as well as consultation and marketing. Metaverse Property currently operates on platforms including Decentraland, The Sanbox, Somnium Space, Cryptovoxels, and Upland.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Beyond being virtual landlords and developers, Metaverse Property also says it is creating what it’s calling the first “metaverse real estate investment trust (REIT)”, which will trade through a non-fungible token (NFT) that is backed by the company’s virtual land portfolio.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With a bullish bet on metaverse real estate, crypto and decentralized financial services company Tokens.com Corp purchased a 50 per cent stake in Metaverse Group this week valued at about $1.7 million, reportedly a record equity investment in a metaverse real estate company.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Andrew Kiguel, the chief executive officer at Tokens.com, explained that the company’s goal is to secure as many virtual real estate land parcels as possible to rent them out to clients.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On platforms like Decentraland, which has seen more than $50 million in virtual sales for goods like real estate, clothes, accessories, usernames and avatars, an outlying parcel in an area less travelled could run a user around $5,000 MANA, or roughly over $4,600 Canadian dollars as of mid-October. These prices can jump up quickly in larger built-out properties in popular zones, with the highest-selling virtual plot of land recorded on the platform being a $1.3 million MANA property in June, equal to about US$900,000 at the time. ...',

      'Next week, the company is expected to announce a huge rebrand, which will focus on its expansion into the so-called metaverse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It\'s a "genius" and "classic" move in the world of branding strategy that could help Facebook, experts told Insider, but ultimately it may not be enough to save the company\'s reputation.\n' +

      "\"Fundamentally, however, this 'so what's next' metaverse story will only save the company so much from public backlash,\" Ashley Cooksley, managing director for North America at The Social Element, a social media management firm, told Insider.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "At the epicenter of Facebook's recent PR woes is a series of leaked documents given to the Wall Street Journal by whistleblower Frances Haugen. The internal documents purport to show Facebook knew it was harming people, specifically teenagers, and knew it years ago. The documents potentially give lawmakers plenty of ammunition for more regulations on the tech giant. \n" +

      'The company is trying to "divert the conversation from their current problems onto the metaverse, which is exciting and futuristic," Anne Olderog — senior partner at the consulting firm Vivaldi with 20 years of brand strategy experience — told Insider.

      '"This is not the kiss of death for Mark Zuckerberg," Schiffer said. "It is absolutely a genius move to shift away, to rebrand to the metaverse in the process, and wash away the past pain in part, but also own the space that will be the dominant battleground over the next couple of decades," referring to the metaverse.\n' +

    content:
      'Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told listeners to his July 2021 quarterly earnings call that “I expect people will transition from seeing us as a social-media company to seeing us as a metaverse company.” A few weeks later, the business plan had morphed into a political plan and the Washington Post headlined, “How Facebook’s ‘metaverse’ became a political strategy in Washington.” “[T]he metaverse is already a full-on political push,” the article explained, with the goal to position the company “far from the controversies of social media”, such as privacy, antitrust, content moderation, and political extremism.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But Zuckerberg is wrong. Far from pushing today’s online problems off the front page, the metaverse heightens our challenges. Issues such as personal privacy, marketplace competition, and misinformation only become greater challenges in the metaverse due to the interconnectedness of that phenomenon. Rather than being distracted by the shiny new bauble, policymakers need to focus on the underlying problems of the digital revolution, which won’t go away with new technological developments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Just what is this “metaverse”? Today’s online activity can be described as a 2D experience; the metaverse is a 3D experience that can utilize augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and persistent connections to create an immersive world. Rather than spending 20-30 minutes a day moving among apps, users spend hours in much more realistic activities. As Zuckerberg explained, “you can think about this [the metaverse] as an embodied internet that you are inside of rather than just looking at.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook “is meeting with think tanks to discuss the creation of standards and protocols for the coming virtual world,” the Post reports. Standards to define technical functionality have long been the backbone of the internet. Unfortunately, those technical rules seldom addressed behavioral effects of the technology.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The threshold question is whether the new quest for standards is more than a strategic deflection from a company beleaguered by regulatory and judicial attacks and weakening support from the general public.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook was built on the demolition of standards—that is what its original motto, “move fast and break things” was all about. The things being broken weren’t physical objects, but the practices that had provided social and economic stability for over a century. Such a breaking of preexisting norms has historically been the path to advances in science, business, and the arts. What is significant about the digital rule-breaking is both the wonder of its innovative new products as well as how those products were implemented without regard to the consequences being created.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In response to the negative fallout from the actions of Facebook as well other digital giants, Facebook launched an advertising campaign that must have cost tens-of-millions of dollars. “Facebook supports updated regulation” the campaign proclaims. If “move fast and break things” destroyed accepted behavioral standards, the advertising is proposing watered-down standards defined in ways so as to not adversely affect Facebook’s business.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The firm deserves credit for at least enumerating ideas at a time when the other digital giants have not been as explicit. The new effort to define standards should also not be dismissed. However, because the new metaverse will be constructed upon much of the “old” online universe, any metaverse policy effort must begin with meaningful rules for what exists now.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The seminal asset, and thus the seminal issue, in the digital era is access to—and control of—personal information. In the current online world, the digital companies have siphoned personal information and then stored, manipulated, and repackaged that data in order to sell access to targeted users. If the metaverse is moving to a persistent pseudo-world, then the amount of data collected will be immense, as will the opportunity to monetize that data. “I think digital goods and creators are just going to be huge,” Zuckerberg explained. Facebook plans to focus on the sale of virtual goods, which like advertising, will require the collection and exploitation of personal data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Control of data also permits control of markets. After capturing personal information, the digital companies’ next step is to build a moat around it to deny access to others. The Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust suit against Facebook describes a “buy-or-bury” strategy it alleges to be illegal. By using cash (or stock) generated from the high-margin exploitation of personal data, it is possible to remove a potential competitor via acquisition. If acquiring a competitor doesn’t work, then the company can simply crush the competition by denying it the data necessary to compete with a copycat service built on the incumbent’s data hoard. The opening advantage in the metaverse will go to those with the data to make the new virtual activities relevant to the user. The result is no different from the present online world in which those with the data hoard it to control the market.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Insofar as the dissemination of hate and lies, tech journalist Casey Newton’s interview with Mark Zuckerberg about his metaverse vision was revealing. Newton asked, “Who gets to augment reality?” He imagined “a world where we’re all wearing our headsets, and we’re looking at the U.S. Capitol building…most of us have an overlay that says, ‘This is the building where Congress works’…[but] some people might see an overlay that says, ‘on January 6, 2021, our glorious revolution began.’” Zuckerberg responded that this “is one of the central questions of our time.” “In order to have a cohesive society,” he explained, “you want to have a shared foundation of values and some understanding of the world and the problems we all face together.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The current iteration of Facebook with its algorithms to promote engagement-driven revenue fall far from that goal. Instead of a “shared foundation” that brings us together, the way the Facebook algorithms are programmed does just the opposite. Since maximizing user time on the site maximizes the number of advertisements that can be sold, the algorithms are programmed to maximize engagement. This means the algorithms send to each user news that is in line with their pre-established views, not news that creates a “shared foundation.” Even worse, is that one of the best ways to hold engagement is to create conflict and outrage, regardless of the veracity of the claim.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Which brings us back to standards. The development of government-overseen behavioral standards protected consumer, workers, and competition in the industrial revolution—while simultaneously enabling a vibrant and growing economy. The digital revolution requires similar government-overseen standards. It is good that Facebook is discussing behavioral standards for the metaverse, but it is not sufficient. We must not be distracted by the shiny new metaverse and forget that we have yet to resolve the challenges in the current online universe—problems that will simply metastasize into the metaverse if we don’t deal with them now.',

    content:
      'Long before the internet entered popular consciousness, there was the Information Superhighway.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The name became popular in the early 1990s to describe the digital backbone that was expected to become a conduit for communications, entertainment and commerce. The media and telecommunications giants of the day dreamed of controlling this pervasive network.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'What finally emerged, in the shape of the internet, was a far more open network of networks, paving the way for an entirely new class of online intermediaries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Decades later, some in the tech world believe they can see a new information realm glittering on the horizon: the metaverse. A fully immersive, virtual reality world, it is a place where people will be able to pursue all aspects of life vicariously, as if in a parallel digital universe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Like with the Information Superhighway, early visions of the metaverse are likely to be an imperfect approximation of what the ultimate reality will look like. What form it takes and what its first “killer apps” will be are a matter of conjecture. And, most importantly, it is not yet settled who will set the rules and collect the profits – though today’s internet giants are in pole position.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Mark Zuckerberg has certainly placed his bet. The Facebook chief executive declared that his company would one day be seen not as a social network, but as a “metaverse company”.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given the political pressure Facebook has been under, this might seem like an attempt at distraction. But trying to shape ideas of the future like this has always been an important way for tech companies to prepare the market for what they plan to sell next, and Zuckerberg has been at this for a while. It is seven years since he bought virtual reality (VR) company Oculus.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'He may well have to wait a while longer to get a return on these investments. To many, the idea of conducting some of your most important personal and social interactions through a digital avatar in a virtual world evokes a remote and not particularly attractive sci-fi future.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Yet after the social isolation foisted on much of the world’s population by the pandemic, the idea of escaping into a fully digital space no longer seems as outlandish. If workers took to Zoom so easily, why not congregate in a digital office?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'And this is not an all-or-nothing affair. Rather than plunging users straight into a full VR world, the metaverse could well take shape more gradually. Using augmented reality to project aspects of the metaverse on to the physical world, for instance, would see it take shape first as a partial digital overlay.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Isolated worlds\n' +
      'The final product could be an ultimate “walled garden”, a place where a single company benefits from the total immersion of users. If Facebook and other big internet companies build their own – and particularly if they each sell their own proprietary hardware to access these zones – then the result could be a collection of isolated worlds, forcing digital citizens to pick where they spend the bulk of their time.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the other hand, the metaverse could comprise a set of more closely interconnected worlds, some of them controlled entirely by their users. This would be a place where people could take their personal data, digital goods and favourite services with them as they move from place to place.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is tempting to view the internet giants as today’s version of the telecoms and media powers of the early-1990s, dreaming of shaping and owning the next iteration of the online medium. In this comparison, it is also tempting to view blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as the decentralising forces of the early internet. Crypto enthusiasts see people owning their own corners of a more fragmented metaverse, rather than throwing all their data in with a few vast platforms.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Yet limiting the power of the dominant tech companies will not be easy. It will depend heavily on the outcome of the global push for more effective regulation. It will also depend on whether the technologies underlying the crypto revolution give rise to new experiences and new ways of interacting that are not available through today’s mass online services. Exactly what those could be is still hard to tell.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As things stand, today’s internet powers are in a good position to dominate a future metaverse. If that happens, then they will end up with far more power to shape the online lives of billions of people than they have now.

      '\n' +
      'But it turns out I’m dangerously overloaded in reality. All of my investments relate to our physical existence as humans on Planet Earth, which, I don’t know if you’ve been following the headlines, but let’s just say I have a Hold rating on it.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deep thinkers, meanwhile, are suddenly abuzz about a greenfield investment opportunity in an alternate world called the metaverse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In a recent report, investment bank Jefferies defines the metaverse as “the convergence of physical and digital in a way that is persistent, real-time rendered, and infinite in its ability to offer shared experiences allowing for a total sense of presence to the point where it embodies us.” I’m not sure what that means, but I’m tempted to go long like a Robinhood trader after three hard seltzers of due diligence.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I just have to find the metaverse first. A word of caution: Don’t call it a videogame, or you’ll risk ridicule from the sort of tech-forward friends who have strong opinions on whether Apple included the right ports in its new MacBook Pro. In fact, to be safe, don’t even call videogames videogames. Roblox (ticker: RBLX), which features pixelated characters on screens and can be accessed through gaming machines, calls itself a “human co-experience platform.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But it’s OK to acknowledge gaming as a building block of the metaverse, which means major metaverse investors include Roblox, Minecraft owner Microsoft (MSFT), and privately held Fortnite creator Epic Games. Add in traditional game makers with metaverse-friendly titles: Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and its Call of Duty franchise; Electronic Arts (EA) with Battlefield; and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) with Grand Theft Auto.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'What all of these multiplayer games have in common is that they’re rapidly becoming rich social networks with some friendly homicide and looting on the side. That has Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg so eager for a move to the metaverse that he’s reportedly considering a name change to reflect his new focus. Faceblox? Markaverse? MetaHate Monetization? Probably not that last one.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One way to enter the metaverse appears to be to strap a toddler’s toilet seat to your forehead. Zuckerberg demonstrated this technique on CBS This Morning in August, when he wore something called an Oculus Quest 2 headset to access Facebook’s new virtual-reality platform for office mates, called Horizon Workrooms. There, up to 16 colleagues can gather as better-looking avatar versions of themselves, complete with body language and hand motions to convey unspoken things, like, say, group exasperation over nearly all of Kevin’s ideas. That could provide Kevin with important performance clues to avoid being one day fired by a cartoon.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Oculus is just one maker of unwieldy metaverse headgear. Sony Group (SONY), HP Inc. (HPQ), and HTC (2498.Taiwan) have preposterous-looking units, too. These could eventually be replaced by glasses that will allow graphics to be overlaid on the real world, called augmented rather than virtual reality. Remember Google Glass? It’s now called Glass Enterprise Edition 2, and Alphabet (GOOGL) is beta testing its Google Meet videoconferencing software on the devices. Facebook recently joined with Ray-Ban to offer its own smart glasses, called Ray-Ban Stories.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Zuckerberg, who is sparring with Apple (AAPL) over new iPhone privacy features that can cut into the profitability of social-media advertising, donned a pair of the shades for a video, calling them “an important step toward a future when phones are no longer a central part of our lives.” It was like watching an android discover sass.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Opportunities for metaverse investment abound. Most range from outrageously valued to financially nihilistic, but there are some values, too. The metaverse will need real-time rendering, or image-drawing, which favors chips from Nvidia (NVDA), which trades at more than 20 times sales, and programs from the likes of Unity Software (U), closer to 40 times sales. Tiny Immersion (IMMR) specializes in haptic feedback that can give the illusion of feeling virtual worlds, and goes for six times sales. Qualcomm (QCOM), at four times sales, makes chips for mobile devices, including smart glasses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There is a metaverse exchange-traded fund that holds these names and more, called Roundhill Ball Metaverse (META). It costs 0.75% of assets. Roundhill Investments is an asset manager. Matthew Ball is a venture capitalist who calls the metaverse the next phase of the internet, and has created an index of companies with enabling technologies. Among his predictions are that the metaverse will be “a fully functioning economy” and an experience “that spans both digital and physical worlds.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Jefferies argues that cryptocurrency and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which can prove ownership of digital images, will come in handy in the metaverse. Morgan Stanley says metaverse functions will extend beyond gaming and social networking to include shopping, concerts, education, virtual travel—even dating.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'About that last one: I can’t help but notice that a baby boom that was predicted in the early days of pandemic lockdown never occurred. Online gaming exploded in popularity. Attention turned to the metaverse. And the U.S. birthrate plunged 4%, to the lowest level ever recorded.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When I was young, kids learned about the birds and bees the way nature intended: with a hidden nine-volt radio and mono earphone tuned each 10 p.m. to a cheerfully frank therapist named Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Today, young people know everything, but live their lives in the metaverse.\n' +

This concept of the future of the internet promises to bring the physical world together with new technologies that are only starting to transform the way people interact with one another, amuse themselves, go shopping and engage in other everyday activities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent a considerable amount of time discussing the metaverse during his quarterly results call in late July. "It\'s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces,” he said. "You can kind of think about this as an embodied internet that you\'re inside of rather than just looking at. We believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile internet.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This might sound all too familiar if you think back to the much heralded second life platform, which failed to gain traction. But because of the pandemic and the general public getting used to doing everything via digital means, the metaverse will be a whole different beast. All signs point to massive potential and possibilities, including the opportunity to completely redefine how we interact with consumers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Isabel Perry, director of technology at Byte (part of Dept) noted, "Metaverses are jam-packed with innovative marketing potential, (ranging) from live shopping to virtual stores, fashion shows, product launches, content production, live flagship events, enhanced social, pimping-up of Zoom calls and NFTs paving the way for real economies. The possibilities that this hybrid digital/physical world offers are near-endless. It\'s time for forward-thinking brands to get involved.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse is the next marketing channel\n' +
      'The metaverse signals a move beyond traditional advertising toward creating brand experiences that are more engaging and exciting and less invasive than what we experience with digital advertising today.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Conventional offline and online advertising methods such as flagship shops, large billboards and other types of traditional offline and internet advertising are becoming a thing of the past. Every age group, from the very young to the very old, is becoming engaged by new innovations, ranging from contextual targeted advertisements to Instagram influencers all the way up to platforms such as Twitch, TikTok, Fortnite and Roblox.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For those looking to build a relationship with the new generation of consumers today, the phrase “in real life” has taken on a whole new significance. Digital alone is not sufficient; it must also be interesting, meaningful and immersive. And this is precisely what the metaverse will accomplish for brands in the near future.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For example, Balenciaga launched its dystopian game Afterworld, showcasing its futuristic clothing line. Fortnite, a player-versus-player game played by hundreds of millions in the Gen Z age group, collaborated with Nike to promote its new Jordan sneakers and teamed up with rapper Travis Scott for a virtual gig to an audience of over 10 million. And the hugely popular esports game League of Legends collaborated with Louis Vuitton for its latest world championship.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Among other examples, Nike materialized virtual stores for its Air Max 720, calling out physical lines in shopping streets as: "so 2k18.” Meanwhile, ComplexLand recently had an interesting take on the metaverse by creating a free, open-world, shoppable virtual destination. And non-traditional games like Axie Infinity even take these new virtual worlds and mix them with real-world economics, allowing many individuals to rely on this as their primary source of income.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'New technologies are providing a boost\n' +
      'Hardware is becoming more compact, quicker and more intelligent. Thanks to 5G, almost everywhere now has fast, dependable connectivity. In the metaverse, computer vision is becoming more intelligent, allowing for both visual and audible help. All of this contributes to the immersion of the experience, making the transfer of knowledge and experience more rewarding and human.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Paul Doyle, director of product management for Unreal Engine at Epic Games put it best: \"Much like the internet and mobile technology were major transformations and major technical ages, now we're about to hit a virtual age. And it's going to be awesome.”\n" +
      '\n' +
      'This is essential for businesses who want to put their customers first. And the metaverse is rapidly becoming the focal center of all of this activity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Non-fungible tokens signal a new frontier for the digital economy\n' +
      'Thanks to NFTs the metaverse has paved the way for real economies. NFTs are about ownership of something unique that cannot be replaced by anything else. They create unique, one-of-a-kind ownership for the likes of digital art, a music performance or a digital asset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "This means brands have access to an entirely new universe for engaging people and doing business with them, just as they would in the physical domain. It's entirely possible that these metaverses will actually exceed the physical universe economy in the future and open the door for limitless possibilities in owning equity in the digital universe.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'The time to take action is now\n' +
      "If you're a marketer dazzled by the possibilities a nascent sphere like this offers, you might ask, \"What do I need to do with my brand in the metaverse?” The answer is to start with the basics: Investigate what's out there, have a hard look at your brand's DNA and find what suits you best.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "Don't forget that the metaverse is still ultimately populated by (real) people who give your brand new ways to grow and stand out. So stay in the loop and don't wake up one day wondering where everybody went.\n" +

    content:
      'A self-described “endless arcade,” Core feels like a 90s cyberpunk fever dream come to life. Half playable game library, half no-code game creator, all neon lights, the new platform is a surprisingly well-realized vision of this metaverse thing everyone sure seems to be talking about lately.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Billing itself as your “portal to the multiverse,” Core is primed to test the age-old proposition If you build it, they will come. Giant companies like Roblox and Facebook might have huge established platforms, but Core has laid some very compelling groundwork for creators and players alike.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logging in, players are transported to Core’s central hub, a fitting cross between a theme park, a high-tech mall and a casino, with entertainment and shopping a few gravitationally unburdened strides away in every direction. Giant neon signs beckon, enticing players to hop into myriad user-generated virtual worlds. Swapping out clothing and in-game gear or inviting a friend to jump in with you takes only a few clicks, and just cruising around and people watching is plenty interesting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If Core looks a lot like Fortnite, that’s not a coincidence. Core, made by Manticore Games, runs on Fortnite-maker Epic’s Unreal engine. And those ties are even deeper: Epic led a $15 million round of investment in the company last year and the platform is exclusively available through the Epic Games Store for PC. In March, Manticore raised $100 million more from a grab bag of major investors and took its creator platform live.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Core might not be a household name yet, but it’s already nailed one of the challenges that any metaverse aspirant has to crack. In my time playing around with Core, the experience of getting from one place to another was often so seamless I wound up in the wrong place by accident. Chalk this up to user error, but instantly being transported — to a Deadmau5 show, to an overgrown dystopian wasteland, to a isometric pirate game — after walking through various portals was one of the more seamless online multiplayer experiences I’ve had in more than a decade of those games.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Core looks great. That’s one strike against Roblox, one of the most successful companies building out a vision for the metaverse. Much like Fortnite, Core’s graphics are cartoony but not too cartoony. Roblox’s under-13 crowd is aging up — a factor that company is actively planning around — and those not-so-young players may soon be looking for a new virtual home with more mature vibes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Any aspiring edgelord would be able to take themselves plenty seriously with Core’s wide selection of custom outfits and avatars. Or you could be a kitty.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deadmau5, metaverse resident\n' +
      'Most of Core’s content is UGC, a.k.a. user-generated content, a new-ish name for an era-defining online phenomenon (don’t blame yourself if the acronym evokes mixed martial arts). But Manticore also has plenty of room to partner up with musicians and brands for elaborate themed in-game experiences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This week, DJ and EDM festival perennial Deadmau5 launched his own, a sprawling, colorful series of experiences described as a “permanent residency in the metaverse.” Core is mostly home to user-made games, but it’s also a natural fit for entertainment and even education — the team noted that some users started hosting game development classes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unlike recent shows in other virtual worlds like Lil Nas X in Roblox or Ariana Grande in Fortnite, the Deadmau5-themed content will stay live after it debuts for anyone to explore. The team at Manticore likened this to how performers like Penn and Teller camp out in Las Vegas for ongoing shows, and the metaphor is very appropriate. But unlike Vegas, performers can be in two places at once: Deadmau5 also announced he’d participate in a music festival hosted on the Ethereum-based virtual platform Decentraland this week.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I watched the show with Deadmau5, né Joel Zimmerman, for an early sneak preview. He wore one of his signature giant animal helmets (I think a cat?) and cyborg angel wings, while I opted for an understated black hoodie, the little black dress of the metaverse. ...',

But you also also don’t get to scale to the world’s biggest without making it accessible to those who don’t have virtual reality or augmented reality headsets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So what do you do?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deliver device-agnostic experiences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“Take virtual events,” Rooom CEO Hans Elstner told me recently on the TechFirst podcast. “If you just say ... it’s only for VR headsets, then you only connect to other people that have this exact version of a VR headset. That is not the world how we see the world or the future.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse has gotten a lot of press lately.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Typically, people think of the metaverse as some alternate reality: a wholly immersive virtual experience like Ready Player One or Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash. That’s aligned with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Horizon Worlds on Oculus, currently in beta: “a social experience where you can explore, play and create in extraordinary ways.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      '(I have early access to Horizon; it crashes frequently on my Oculus Quest 2.)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'That’s a valid way of thinking about the metaverse: endless virtual worlds interconnected by portals for work, play, exploration, connection, and pretty much anything else you can imagine doing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But what if the metaverse is something that we’ve been living for decades already? Something that you can experience deeply when drinking from the firehose of a high-end VR headset and something that you can dip a toe in via a text-based interface and something that you could dive a little deeper into via two-dimensional video on a screen?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In other words, something that works with whatever device you have.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'And something that works at whatever level of immersion you’re comfortable with.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“What we’re focusing on is a platform that is running on almost every device,” says Elstner. “You could use your VR headset. You could also use your smartphone. You could use your tablet. You could use your desktop. It should be quite easy, accessible.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rooom, which just recently emerged from stealth mode with a $7 million series A, created the immersive digital environments for IFA 2020, accommodating 200,000+ virtual attendees at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic for one of the biggest consumer electronics trade shows in the world. It’s also doing virtual events for Augmented World Expo, Deutsche Telekom, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and Vodafone. The key: delivering web-based 3D experiences that are cross-platform for virtually any device.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“So [many technologies] are just 2D platforms for sharing video,”Elstner says. “It’s not that engaging ... we call it fake 3D.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“And some others just do it in a very VR-headset focused way. The problem is the fake 2D is not that engaging, and the VR headset makes it necessary to have special, sometimes expensive devices.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The metaverse, Elstner says, is already all around us, connecting as many different people, businesses, and parts of life as possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In other words, it’s the internet.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'And the internet is designed to be used for both high-res immersion and lower-resolution suck-from-a-straw toe-dipping.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '“On one hand, you can use a VR headset and so you have virtual reality right on your headset,” he says. “And it just works on almost every VR headset because we are using a technology — it’s called WebGL and OpenXR by Khronos Group. So it works right in the browser, no matter what kind of device. On the other hand, you can utilize and use 3D right in the browser also, quite easy, no installation necessary with a little bandwidth.”\n' +
      '\n' +
      'That works for Rooom when it’s building virtual events or virtual spaces for its clients. But it’s also a definition that works for the rest of us when we think about metaverse and get tempted to dramatize and glorify what it is. In this version of the metaverse, doing a Google search via Alexa on a smart speaker is accessing the metaverse, even if in a very low-resolution and surface way. So is watching YouTube on your phone. So is reading news on an iPad.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is also (and increasingly) an immersive 3D virtuality that we can inhabit via VR headsets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'But being such doesn’t negate the other, quicker, easier, more accessible, and less attention-hogging methods. And that’s a comforting thought for those of us who have read Snow Crash.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Which, after all, is a dystopian novel.\n' +

    content:
      'Facebook has shared scant details about its upcoming metaverse, but a first look at prototype headsets might provide some insight into how it will operate. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously described the company\'s metaverse as "a persistent, synchronous environment" where people can gather, noting it will feature VR and AR components. Additionally, Zuckerberg suggested it will resemble a hybrid between existing social platforms, and incorporate some gaming features as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The term “metaverse” originated in science fiction, where several books and movies have portrayed characters using VR devices to immerse themselves in fantastical, digital worlds. Facebook’s metaverse is seemingly inspired by those ideas, yet it is different in that it will encapsulate both VR and AR elements. Though the two technologies are related, they are still distinctly separate. VR is about immersion in a computer-generated space, while AR overlays digital objects onto the real world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Zuckerberg recently shared a photo where the Facebook CEO was wearing an Oculus-like device, noting that it is “next-generation virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence tech.” Shortly after, soon-to-be CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth posted a shot to Twitter wearing a distinctly different prototype, linking the headset to technologies that will underpin the metaverse. Based on the images, it's possible Zuckerberg’s Oculus-like device supports VR and AR, allowing the wearer to move seamlessly between those experiences. By contrast, Bosworth’s slimmer unit is more reminiscent of existing AR and MR devices like the Magic Leap One or Microsoft’s HoloLens. It's reasonable to consider then Bosworth's headset is designed to work with AR only, which in-turn could infer much of the metaverse may be centered on AR, rather than VR.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'AR Might Be Better For Those That Don’t Like VR\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At first blush, the idea of VR not being as major of an aspect of the metaverse as previously thought might sound counterintuitive. After all, Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 and has invested heavily in the subsidiary ever since. However, AR could be the better technology to encourage participation in the metaverse. Many have avoided VR due to motion sickness and other associated issues that can occur when immersed in a fully digital world. AR is also better suited to those that don’t want to remove a headset for every real-world interaction. To this point, Facebook has demonstrated its work on a wrist-mounted AR controller. It’s reasonable to consider an AR headset and arm-based wearable would be a better combination for many spaces, such as an office, school, or family home.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Still, as Zuckerberg indicates, development of the metaverse and the products that will support it are still at an early stage. It’s possible that many decisions about how it will operate are still a long way from being decided, and that these prototype devices are being developed to simply help inform those choices. While Zuckerberg and Bosworth are showing off differing products, it’s worth considering that when Facebook's multiverse does actually become reality, consumers may be using an entirely different device to access it.",

      "The customers of tomorrow will be in the metaverse, we're told. Facebook is so convinced of this, it is planning to change its name to reflect its commitment to the metaverse (or maybe to distance itself from its past; we'll leave that to you to decide). But will anyone be selling or marketing to these consumers? Brands and agencies may not be structured to take advantage of this burgeoning marketing channel, according to metaverse specialists.\n" +

      'The industry has been historically slow to adapt to major technological changes, from the birth of the modern internet to the shift to mobile, social and cloud in Web 2.0.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '"A lot of money and time were wasted at the beginnings of these S-curves," says Alex Wills, chief experience officer of post-production facility The Mill. With Web 3.0 approaching—a more immersive, connected, and open version of the internet—Wills recommends brands and agencies develop a framework strategy to allow for early experimentation and experience development.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This will require "much deeper" agency-brand relationships, a greater reliance on partners and freelance talent, and fluid internal structures, experts tell Campaign Asia-Pacific.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Indeed, legacy structures and thinking are often cited as the biggest obstructions to marketing innovation. As part of an in-depth series exploring marketing in the metaverse, Campaign asked five experts whether they expect the 'beyond universe' to cause shifts in brand and agency structures. Their full answers below.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'There’s a lot of factors causing shifts in brand and agency structures, whether it’s Covid, fee structures, remote talent, shifting to projects over retainers, etc. But the metaverse definitely will create and amplify a lot of these shifts. For the first part, I think it’ll force brands and agencies to have a much deeper business strategy relationship. Given communities are the crux of the metaverse, it’s imperative to share more data and be extremely aligned in brand, community, product and future objectives.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While I don’t think project relationships are going anywhere, I think having a couple of solid thinkers and orchestrators as part of a team will be crucial. Having a partner in this space is crucial, as you need someone constantly thinking about the bigger picture with you or you risk being stuck in gimmicky marketing that’ll be rejected by the communities wanting authenticity in the metaverse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'I also think we’ll see a more even mixture of full-time and freelance talent. Given no one can be an expert in everything, we need to be more agile in when and how we tap talent while making sure it’s beneficial for all partners. Finally, I think the continuous rise in creators in the metaverse will see partnerships becoming a much larger aspect of brand and agency relationships. Not everything needs to be under the same roof, but proven success with different partners will increase the objectiveness of putting together business solutions for the metaverse. ...',

      '\n' +
      "The metaverse is a vision for a new place to interact with other humans and bots to play games, conduct business, socialize and shop. That's the metaverse of the future. Right now, the metaverse is a grab bag of hardware, software and unrelated experiences. You likely have seen one piece of the metaverse in a standalone form, as a game or maybe a training session. There is no connective tissue to bring all these components together–yet. \n" +
      '\n' +
      "If you've played Pokemon Go and caught a creature that you can only see via your phone, that's augmented reality (or location-based entertainment, if you want to get picky about it). \n" +
      '\n' +
      "Facebook's Horizon Workrooms are an example of mixed reality. You use the Oculus Quest 2 to join a virtual office space, but you also can see your hands and your keyboard. Also, colleagues not joining the meeting via a VR headset can join via a video feed that shows up in the virtual world just as it would in a live conference room.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "With the virtual office platform Virbela, you navigate an office in the cloud with a full-body avatar via your keyboard. The platform uses directional sound, which means that a person's voice changes as he or she moves closer to your avatar or farther away. The experience is not quite like a video game but it definitely feels like a new space for interacting with colleagues.\n" +
      '\n' +
      "If you've played Animal Crossing or Fortnite, those online worlds give a hint of what the metaverse could look like. You'll be able to build your own world or visit someone else's in your true-to-life form or in a completely new shape.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'Companies and military trainers are using virtual reality and augmented reality for training as well. Penske Truck Leasing uses the XR Mentor training platform to train technicians and support them in the field. Instructors live stream classes to students, and students can use assisted reality devices to refer to training documents when working on vehicles.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "It is possible to buy real estate in virtual worlds, such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels, although those are definitely the world of early adopters. If you've made it as far as buying cryptocurrency or NFTs, you've also gotten a taste of the metaverse.\n" +
      '\n' +
      'The difference between these experiences and the full-on metaverse is the physical sensation of being in another place and sharing it with other people. For most of these experiences, you are interacting with the online world through a controller or other piece of hardware. Although VR worlds are immersive, the headsets are still awkward, which currently defines the entire experience as something out of the ordinary.\n' +
      '\n' +
      "Adam Compton, director of strategy for Schneider Electric, sees the metaverse as a fully immersive, partially real life, partially digital experience that runs in parallel with the physical world. \"It's something that we don't recognize when we're stepping in and out of the two spaces,\" he said.\n" +

      'Mark Zuckerberg and other tech leaders imagine a very different metaverse when they talk about it. The metaverse currently under development would be right next to reality and always on. It would have its own currency and objects in the metaverse would be interoperable–for instance, you could wear a hoodie bought in one corner of the metaverse in every other spot you visit.\n' +

      "World leaders and individuals are starting to recognize the downside of one company running a giant social experiment, such as Facebook. It's easy to imagine the biases that are built into algorithms showing up in the metaverse as well. Figuring out ethics for AI will be a good training ground for making sure that the metaverse is equally accessible to everyone and that there's no automatic penalty for a thin bank account or a slow internet connection.\n" +

      'Facebook announced in September 2021 a $50 million investment designed to avoid the mistakes of the past while building the metaverse. The company will work with Howard University, Seoul National University and the University of Hong Kong to study safety, ethics, equity and design concepts for the metaverse. ...',

      'Imagine a place where you could always stay young, name a city after yourself, or even become the president — sounds like a dream? Well, if not in the real world, such dreams can definitely be fulfilled in the virtual world of a metaverse. The metaverse is believed by some to be the future of the internet, where apart from surfing, people would also be able to enter inside the digital world of the internet, in the form of their avatars. \n' +

      'The advent of AR, blockchain, and VR devices in the last few years has sparked the development of the metaverse. Moreover, the unprecedented growth of highly advanced technologies in the gaming industry, which offer immersive gameplay experiences, not only provides us a glimpse of how the metaverse would look like but also indicates that we are closer than ever to experience a virtual world of our own.\n' +

      'What is the metaverse?\n' +

      'A metaverse is a group of persistent, shared 3D virtual environments where you (in the form of your digital avatar) can visit places, shop for products, subscribe to services, work with your colleagues, play games, and even customize the scenes around you to meet your personal tastes and requirements, and the digital assets you own. So essentially, a metaverse is a virtual world or worlds, that would allow you to go inside the digital world — to be in rather than on the digital space.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The concept of a metaverse has been depicted in The Matrix, Pokemon Go, Minority Report, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Black Mirror, and countless other movies, video games, and TV shows. However, people still await to experience an immersive metaverse in the real world. Interestingly, companies like Facebook and Microsoft have already announced million-dollar plans directed towards the creation of the metaverse.\n' +

      'A brief history of the metaverse\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The idea of a metaverse was first introduced in 1994’s Snow Crash, a sci-fi novel, and now cult classic, written by American writer Neal Stephenson. In his book, Stephenson defined the metaverse as an advanced stage of the internet — a virtual alternative to physical reality. The next year, a company named ActiveWorlds Inc. launched Active Worlds, an online virtual world based on the metaverse discussed in Snow Crash. \n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prior to the release of Stephenson’s novel, virtual environments similar to the metaverse had already appeared in some MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) and in other novels based on retro-futuristic themes, but none of them had discussed the metaverse with such clarity as Snow Crash.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In 2004, an American-Indian inventor Bhargav Sri Prakash launched Vmerse metaverse, a real-time, consumer-facing, virtual reality simulation that was developed to support real-world applications, such as the college recruitment process, alumni relations management, emergency response training programs, etc. The University of Michigan used Vmerse to provide assistance to applicants from underserved sections of society in their admission process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The technology was later implemented by other institutes in the US as well including Stanford University, Louisiana State University, and many others. Moreover, the United States Department of State used Vmerse to guide foreign students about the admission process in American universities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Google also launched (in Beta) an online virtual environment in July 2008 called Google Lively. This service allowed people to chat, watch photos and videos in a virtual room, and the design of the room could also be customized according to the user’s preferences. However, Google Lively was shut down on December 31, 2008, as it failed to attract users and didn’t turn out to be profitable for Google.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the last 10 years, numerous other 3D applications and games (Fortnite, Minecraft, etc.) were launched by High Fidelity Inc., Sinespace, Facebook, Epic Games, Sorilax, and many other brands, for providing an improved metaverse experience. ...',

      'Facebook is at the start of a journey to help build the next computing platform. Working with others, we’re developing what is often referred to as the metaverse — a new phase of interconnected virtual experiences using technologies like virtual and augmented reality. At its heart is the idea that by creating a greater sense of “virtual presence”, interacting online can become much closer to the experience of interacting in person. The metaverse has the potential to help unlock access to new creative, social and economic opportunities. And Europeans will be shaping it right from the start.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'No one company will own and operate the metaverse. Like the internet, its key feature will be its openness and interoperability. Bringing this to life will take collaboration and cooperation across companies, developers, creators and policymakers. For Facebook, it will also require continued investment in product and tech talent, as well as growth across the business.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So today, we’re announcing a plan to create 10,000 new high-skilled jobs within the European Union (EU) over the next five years. This investment is a vote of confidence in the strength of the European tech industry and the potential of European tech talent.\n' +
